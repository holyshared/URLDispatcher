# Fitzgerald needs a new home!

I haven't worked with PHP in over 2 years at this point, and this

Thanks!

##  Fitzgerald is a tiny PHP framework that was inspired oh so heavily by the wondrous Sinatra of the Ruby world.

See example.php for a look at how to use Fitzgerald, and read the blog posts:
